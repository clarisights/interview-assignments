**Objective**: This task is intended to test
1. Thinking through the problem
2. Code quality
3. Component Performance
4. Unit Tests
5. Documentation

**Problem Statement**: Clarisights is a data visualization platform. The heart of data visualization tool is tables. 
We intend our tables to be top notch and smooth while loading 1000s of rows. We would like you to build a table which
can handle up to 1000 rows without hiccups. The table is expected to have the following:

1. Data should match the given API response.
2. Trends chart as to how the data modifies over time.
3. Total sum of all metrics in the column name.

The given API response contains 4 metrics for 1000 campaigns. 
`aj_coh_0w_ios_real_acquisition`, `aj_app_and_installs`, `aj_app_ios_installs` and `aj_coh_0w_and_real_acquisition`. 
You are expected to display only 2 metrics `aj_app_and_installs`, `aj_coh_0w_and_real_acquisition` in your table.

Note: You can use any libraries needed to build this component, document your performance optimizations done and ensure interactions with the component are smooth.

**Bonus:** In the column heading if you can give an option to toggle trend chart for that column would be neat.

To review you can add @ankuriitk and @ashu210890 to your repository.
